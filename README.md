 ## Description
 This is a program to create a README file from the Command Line Interface. I created this program to streamline the process of making a project README file. I also wanted to gain a deeper understanding of open source Node JS packages such as inquirer and fs. In addition to saving time, utilising this program ensures a consistant layout to my README files.
